My wife had a vision of a big grid of recurring todos that would either be green or red, depending on how much time remained; the point would be able to look at all the categories at once and see which areas of one's life were out of balance.

It sounded like a good project to practice building a full express app w/ user authentication, so I built this as a christmas present. It looks like a watermelon when it's all filled out.

- JavaScript (ES6) / Node.js
- Bootstrap / JQuery / Pug (serverside templating)
- ExpressJs server
- PassportJs authentication
- MongoDB
- Deployed w/ Heroku
